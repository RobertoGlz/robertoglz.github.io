### Research

I am interested in Development Economics, Political Economy and Applied Econometrics.<br /> My goal as a researcher is to provide insights that help end poverty.

I am currently working as a Research Fellow at Stanford GSB.

Within my webpage you can find my [Research](https://robertoglz.github.io/research), [CV](https://robertoglz.github.io/files/robertogonzalez_cv.pdf), and [Teaching materials](https://robertoglz.github.io/teaching).

Please, do reach out if you are interested in collaborating in research projects.

### Educational Background

I graduated from an MA in Economic Theory at ITAM in December 2024 in Mexico City. I expect to get my degree in 2026. 

I hold a BA in Economics (ITAM, 2022). You can look at my undergrad thesis exploring the effects of Seguro Popular on mortality [here](https://robertoglz.github.io/files/tesis_BA_RobertoGonzalez.pdf). I was awarded with _Honorary Mention_ in the _2023 Banamex Prize in Economic Research_ in the Undergraduate Theses category due to this work.

### Non-academic things I enjoy

I like playing football (soccer) and going out for runs.<br /> I'm always down for having a good steak and I enjoy drinking _mate_ with my friends (and by myself as well!).
